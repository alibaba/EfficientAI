The user wants to modify both their food and drink orders. First, the food: they want a Caesar salad without anchovies. The function ChaFod is for changing food items. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The original food item isn't specified, but the user is changing it to a Caesar salad. So foodItem should be \"Caesar salad\". They want to remove anchovies, so removeIngredients is \"anchovies\". No new ingredients are mentioned, so newIngredients can be left as default. Special instructions might be optional here, but since they just removed anchovies, maybe that's covered under removeIngredients.\n\nNext, the drink order. The user refers to order 123, so drink_id is \"123\". They want a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The function ChaDri.change_drink requires drink_id and new_preferences. The new_preferences should include size: \"large\", temperature: \"hot\", sweetness_level: \"regular\", milk_type: \"almond\". Special instructions aren't mentioned here.

The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes to Git, and then commit and push. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so it'll default to the current directory. I'll call clone_repo with that URL.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function needs the directory_name. Since we cloned it into the current directory, the directory name is probably 'nodejs-welcome' or similar. Wait, the cloned repo's directory might be the same as the repo name. So I'll use directory_name='nodejs-welcome' here. This will determine the predominant language, which is needed for creating Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs.\n\nThen, create the Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function requires the directory_name. Using the same directory name as before. But wait, the analysis might have shown the language, say Node.js. The Dockerfile creation might need that info, but the function parameters don't include it. Hmm, maybe the function uses the directory's contents to decide, but the user's function parameters only take directory_name. So I'll proceed with the directory name.\n\nThen, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file needs directory_name, and optionally deployment_name, image_name, etc. The analysis might have given the language, which could influence the image name. For example, if it's Node.js, the image might be node:latest. But the function's parameters don't take the language; they take directory_name and other options. So I'll use the directory name and set image_name to something like 'nodejs-welcome:latest' or use the default 'latest'. The user might want to use the repo name as the deployment name. So maybe deployment_name is 'nodejs-welcome' and image_name is 'nodejs-welcome:latest'. The default port is 80, which is okay for Node.js apps. So I'll call create_kubernetes_yaml_file with directory_name and those parameters.\n\nAfter creating the files, add all changes to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, commit_message, branch_name, etc. The user didn't specify a commit message, so use the default 'Update changes'. Branch is default 'main', unless specified. So call push_git_changes_to_github with the directory name.\n\nWait, but the steps mention \"add all changed file to git changes\". The push function automatically adds changes, so maybe after creating the Dockerfile and YAMLs, we need to run git add ., but the push function does that. So the steps are: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAMLs, then push. The push function handles adding changes. So the functions to call are clone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, and push_git_changes_to_github.\n\nBut the user's step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might be redundant because push_git_changes_to_github does that. So maybe the order is correct. Now, check parameters for each function.\n\nFor clone_repo: repo_url is given. Destination defaults to '.', so no problem. Recursive and depth are optional, defaulting to False and None. So call clone_repo(repo_url='git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git').\n\nAnalyse_repo_contents needs directory_name. Assuming the cloned repo is in the current directory, the directory name is 'nodejs-welcome' (the repo name). So analyse_repo_contents(directory_name='nodejs-welcome').\n\nCreate Dockerfile: create_a_docker_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome').\n\nCreate Kubernetes YAML: create_kubernetes_yaml_file(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', deployment_name='nodejs-welcome', image_name='nodejs-welcome:latest', port=80, service_type='ClusterIP'). The user didn't specify replicas, so default to 1. The image_name defaults to 'latest', but maybe better to specify it as 'nodejs-welcome:latest' to be explicit.\n\nPush: push_git_changes_to_github(directory_name='nodejs-welcome', commit_message='Update changes', branch_name='main').\n\nSo the function calls in order would be:\n\nclone_repo, analyse_repo_contents, create_a_docker_file, create_kubernetes_yaml_file, push_git_changes_to_github.\n"}

First, they want updated information on significant events, news articles, and developments since October 2021, but specifically only information published after 2022. They also mentioned wanting a digital painting of a masked woman with certain artistic elements.\n\nStarting with the first part: the user is asking for recent news and developments. The available functions include a search engine that can filter results by year. The search_engine.query function has an 'include_after_year' parameter which can be set to True to get info from 2022 onwards. The prompt should be exactly as the user provided: 'significant events, news articles, and developments that since October 2021'. But since they want only post-2022, I'll set include_after_year to True. The source can default to Google unless specified otherwise.\n\nNext, the user wants a digital painting. The generate_image function can create images based on a prompt. The description is detailed: masked woman with peacock feathers, cyberpunk Alphonse Mucha style. I'll need to translate that into a prompt. Maybe something like \"a masked woman with bright peacock feathers, complex and elegant design, green highlighted lines, intricate patterns, cyberpunk style inspired by Alphonse Mucha\". The resolution can be default, but maybe higher quality? The image_quality parameter can be set to 90 for better quality. Color mode could be RGB as default. \n\nWait, there's also generate_human_image, but that's more specific to humans. The user's image is a masked woman, so generate_image is more appropriate since it's a digital painting, not a realistic human image. The generate_human_image might have limitations on style or complexity. So stick with generate_image.\n\nCheck parameters: prompt is required. For generate_image, the prompt needs to be descriptive. The user's description is quite detailed, so I'll include all those elements. Also, the image_quality can be set to 90, and maybe resolution to 1920x1080 for higher detail. Color mode RGB is fine.\n\nSo two function calls: one for the search and one for the image generation. Make sure the search includes only after 2022. The user specified \"Include only information published after the year 2022,\" so include_after_year=True. The source can stay as default Google unless the user specified another, which they didn't. \n\nDouble-check parameters for each function. No missing required parameters. The search_engine.query requires 'prompt', which is provided. The generate_image needs 'prompt', which is constructed. All set.\n"}

The 'send_message' function can be used here. The recipient should be Shishir, so I'll set the recipient parameter to his identifier, which might be his email or username. The message is straightforward: \"Happy Birthday!\". Since it's a birthday message, maybe setting urgent to True would prioritize it, but the default is False. I'll check if the function allows urgent, and if so, include it. However, the default is False, so unless specified, it's better to leave it as is. Wait, the user didn't mention urgency, so maybe just the message and recipient are needed. But the function requires 'message' as a required parameter, and 'recipient' has a default. But since the user specified Shishir, I need to provide the recipient. Assuming the default is not Shishir, I should input his correct identifier. But since I don't have that info, maybe the function's default is a placeholder. However, the user wants to send it to Shishir, so I need to make sure the recipient is correctly set. But without knowing his exact identifier, maybe the function's default is a placeholder, but the user expects it to be Shishir. Hmm, this is a problem. The function's recipient parameter has a default of 'default@example.com', but the user wants to send it to Shishir. Therefore, I need to specify the recipient as Shishir's email or username. Since I don't have that info, maybe the previous conversation might have stored it. Wait, the first step is to search for Shishir's birthday. Maybe the same conversation history also includes his contact info. But the 'recall_memory_search' query is for the birthday. If the search returns the birthday, maybe the contact info is elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the recipient is known. Since the user hasn't provided it, but the function requires it, I have to assume that the recipient is known or that the default is acceptable. But the user specifically wants to send it to Shishir, so the recipient must be set. However, without knowing his exact identifier, perhaps the function's default is a placeholder, but the user expects it to be Shishir. This is a bit of a problem. Maybe the user expects that the system already knows Shishir's contact info from previous interactions. Therefore, I'll proceed by setting the recipient to 'Shishir' as the identifier, assuming that the system can resolve it. Alternatively, maybe the function's default is a placeholder, but the user wants to override it. So, in the send_message function, I'll set recipient to 'Shishir' and message to 'Happy Birthday!'.\n\nSo the steps are: first, search for Shishir's birthday using recall_memory_search, then send the message using send_message with the recipient as Shishir.\n"}

The user is facing a compilation error in their Java project. The class 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides methods like 'getCellValue', 'setCellValue', 'getExcelType', and 'getDefaultExcelFormat'. The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'.\n\nFirst, the user wants to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' in the repository, including subdirectories. The function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate here. The parameters needed are 'search_string', which would be 'CellResult', and 'include_subdirectories' set to true. That should retrieve any classes related to CellResult across the entire repository.\n\nNext, the user needs the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function can be used for this. They need to call this function twice, once for each method. The parameters would be 'class_name' as 'AbstractCellHandler' and 'method_name' as 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' respectively. This will ensure they have the correct parameters and return types to override the methods properly.\n\nAlso, since the error mentions 'CellResult', it's possible that 'getNumericValue()' is supposed to be part of that class. But since it's not found, maybe the user needs to check if 'CellResult' is correctly imported or if there's a typo. However, the user hasn't mentioned import issues yet, so maybe the first step is to find related classes to see if 'CellResult' is correctly defined or if there's a missing class.\n\nSo, the plan is to first use get_relevant_classes with 'CellResult' and include subdirectories. Then, get the method signatures for the two methods in AbstractCellHandler. That should help the user verify their overrides and check if 'CellResult' is properly referenced.\n"}

The user is facing a compilation error because there's no suitable method called get_weather(String) in the Weather class. They want to know the available methods and properties of the Weather class and the signature of the get_weather method if it exists.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which functions to use. The available functions are get_class_info, get_signature, get_relevant_classes, and get_imports. \n\nThe user is asking for two things: the class info and the method signature. So, I should start by using get_class_info to retrieve all the methods and properties of the Weather class. The parameters needed are class_name and optionally module_name. Since the user didn't specify the module, I'll assume it's the current module, so module_name can be omitted or set to None. The include_private parameter defaults to False, which is fine unless the user wants private members, but they didn't mention that.\n\nNext, they want the signature of the get_weather method. For that, the get_signature function is needed. It requires class_name and method_name. The user mentioned the method is in the same class, so using the same class_name as before. The method_name is get_weather. Again, include_private is optional and defaults to False, which should be okay.\n\nWait, but what if the get_weather method is private? The user's error might be because the method isn't found, possibly due to being private. But since the user didn't specify, I should first check with include_private set to False. If that doesn't work, maybe they need to include private methods, but the initial step is to check the default.\n\nSo the plan is to first call get_class_info for the Weather class to see all available methods and properties. Then call get_signature for get_weather in the same class. If the method isn't found, maybe the user needs to check for private methods, but the initial calls should cover the standard case.\n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly set. For get_class_info, class_name is 'Weather'. For get_signature, class_name is 'Weather' and method_name is 'get_weather'. Both functions are necessary here. The other functions like get_relevant_classes and get_imports don't seem relevant here since the user is asking about an existing class's methods, not searching for classes or resolving imports.\n"}

The math_gcd function is available, which takes two integers a and b. Since 36 and 48 are both non-negative integers, I can use this function. The larger number is 48, so a should be 48 and b 36. That should give the GCD.\n\nNext, the second part involves finding the steepness of the curve f(x) = x\u00b2 at x = 5. Steepness relates to the derivative of the function at that point. The estimate_derivative function can be used here. The parameters needed are the function, the point x, and optionally dx and method. The function is f(x) = x\u00b2, which I can represent as a lambda function. The x value is 5. The default method is central difference, which is accurate, so I can use that without specifying dx unless needed. Since the user didn't mention a specific method or dx, I'll use the defaults. \n\nSo, I need to call math_gcd with a=48 and b=36, then call estimate_derivative with function=lambda x: x**2, x=5.

The parameters needed are function, x, dx, and method. The function here is lambda x: x**2. x is 5. The default dx is 0.001, and method defaults to central. Since the user didn't specify dx or method, I can use the defaults. So I'll call estimate_derivative with function=lambda x: x**2, x=5. That should give the derivative using the central difference method with dx=0.001. \n\nWait, do I need to check if the parameters are correctly formatted? The function expects a callable, so the lambda is correct. x is a float, which 5 is. So both function calls should work. Let me make sure I didn't mix up any parameters. Yep, looks good.
